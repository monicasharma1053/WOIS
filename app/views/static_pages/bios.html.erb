						With a reputation for integrity, independence of thought, a sense of humor and an unrelenting focus on results, Sallie Krawcheck has often been referred to as one of the most successful and influential executives in financial services. From turning around and growing troubled wealth management businesses to eliminating Wall Street conflicts of interest and advocating a true client-centered business model, Fortune Magazine called her "The Last Honest Analyst" during her tenure at Sanford Bernstein. After years spent as the guardian of such brands as Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and US Trust, Krawcheck's long run as a successful public company executive was upended in 2011 in a management shake up that would transform the next stretch of her professional life. A renewed focus on her passions - women in business, regulatory reform, and investor protection - has made Krawcheck a sought-after business and financial services industry expert for both traditional and non-traditional media, as well as in Washington, D.C. Krawcheck's embrace of social media as a means of including more people in her frank business conversations has garnered her more than 190,000 (and growing) followers as one of LinkedIn's INfluencers and 17,000 followers on Twitter. She recently combined a number of these interests in her investment in 85 Broads, a 30,000-strong global professional woman's network. A Tar Heel fan through and through, Krawcheck also spends her time advising start-up companies, focusing on education-oriented philanthropy and serving on a variety of boards.

						Cordelia started her career in public affairs, having studied Politics at the University of Bristol. After working towards the 1997 General Election, Cordelia worked for Rt Hon David Mellor PC QC as his Special Advisor where she started to learn about the media, and how it could combine with a business. To really learn the trade, Cordelia then joined Brunswick where she worked on fabulous accounts such as Pearson, Camelot, St James Place Capital and Esporta – ending up on secondment to the Lawn Tennis Association as Deputy Head of Communications. Having seen a little from the client side, Cordelia then joined Tarsus Group plc as Global PR Manager where she spent five years traveling the globe - including regular trips across Europe, the USA and Asia - supporting various high profile conferences and exhibitions. After a brief stint as Head of Communications at Reading Room, the leading design and build web agency in Soho, Cordelia joined Ballard Associates where she led European-wide accounts such as Erste Bank, OMV, Wienerberger, Wolf Theiss and Staffline.
					<p>
						Cordelia was then appointed Head of UK at IF Communications where she both managed the UK team, worked on new business, and ran several accounts across the venture, startup, tech, mobile and digital space. After the merger of IF Communications with Hotwire PR, Cordelia joined Hotwire as a Director where she brought across all her venture and tech accounts, plus worked on Intuit and various internal projects. However, spurred on by huge support from colleagues, clients and friends, in April 2012 Cordelia officially launched FieldHouse Associates.
					<p>
						Cordelia is also delighted to have been a Consultant for Silicon Valley Comes to the UK, and to be a Mentor for BBC Worldwide Labs.
					<p>
						Cordelia said, “With a background in cross-sector corporate PR, financial PR, events management, and public affairs, I am currently primarily focused on the b2b tech and venture space. This fascinating and innovative sector is growing faster than we can imagine - hence the Government's involvement, and the investment into the UK from companies like Silicon Valley Bank. Will the next Facebook or Apple be found in the UK - I don't know - but if they are here I am all set to find them, help them build a profile, connect them with investors, and help them find the funding they need to take things to the next stage. Finger's crossed!”
