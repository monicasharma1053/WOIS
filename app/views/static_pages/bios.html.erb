						With a reputation for integrity, independence of thought, a sense of humor and an unrelenting focus on results, Sallie Krawcheck has often been referred to as one of the most successful and influential executives in financial services. From turning around and growing troubled wealth management businesses to eliminating Wall Street conflicts of interest and advocating a true client-centered business model, Fortune Magazine called her "The Last Honest Analyst" during her tenure at Sanford Bernstein. After years spent as the guardian of such brands as Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and US Trust, Krawcheck's long run as a successful public company executive was upended in 2011 in a management shake up that would transform the next stretch of her professional life. A renewed focus on her passions - women in business, regulatory reform, and investor protection - has made Krawcheck a sought-after business and financial services industry expert for both traditional and non-traditional media, as well as in Washington, D.C. Krawcheck's embrace of social media as a means of including more people in her frank business conversations has garnered her more than 190,000 (and growing) followers as one of LinkedIn's INfluencers and 17,000 followers on Twitter. She recently combined a number of these interests in her investment in 85 Broads, a 30,000-strong global professional woman's network. A Tar Heel fan through and through, Krawcheck also spends her time advising start-up companies, focusing on education-oriented philanthropy and serving on a variety of boards.
