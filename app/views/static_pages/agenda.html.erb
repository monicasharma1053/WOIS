					Women in Top Teams as an Investment Criteria - Good Business Sense
				</td>
				<td>
					How should investors value the presence of women entrepreneurs on the top team (as founders, executives, and board members) as a criteria for investment? How is this a sound investment decision? While Dow Jones confirms, "Companies have a greater chance of either going public, operating profitably, or being sold for more money than they've raised when they have females acting as founders, board members, C-level officers, vice presidents, and/or directors." (Dow Jones, 2012) - this is not part of the current day ethos. How do we chance the outdated thinking?
